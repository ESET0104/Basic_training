Theory on Machine learning:

Linear Regression: one of the types of supervised learning
- used for predicting numerical data in liner form (y = mx + c)

Steps in linear regression:
- importing required libraries
- gathering data
- Defining our feature(x) and target(y)
- divide the data into training and testing
- Model training (x_train, y_train)
- validation/testing (x_test, y_test)
- Model evaluation( accuracy, precision, MSE, F1 score)
- data visualization
