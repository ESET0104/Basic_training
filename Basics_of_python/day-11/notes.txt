Unsupervised learning:
analysing data without an initial determination of the required output. the analysis is done on the data structure itself.

core tasks of Unsupervised learning:
1. Clustering
2. Dimensionality reduction
3. Anamoly detection

Clustering: The task of grouping similar data points together. The algorithm tries to form clusters where the points within a cluster are very similar, and the points in different clusters are very dissimilar.

k-means clustering: a popular, intuitive, and powerful clustering algorithm using a centroid based algorithm.
